### About Me 
Hi there! üëãüèº My name is Ann, and I'm an incoming master's student in Data Science at Boston University.

I received my bachelor's degree in Operations and Information Management from the University of Massachusetts Amherst, where I discovered my natural aptitude for embracing obstacles and finding solutions to various problems. Through my work, life, and leadership experiences, I've developed a strong passion for improving public services. I believe data is the key to making decisions that optimize outcomes for global communities.

I'm particularly interested in business analytics and bioinformatics. As an aspiring data scientist, I'm eager to bridge the gaps in human-machine collaboration to drive positive change.
